An example for spin_orbit=True
--------------------------------------

## Requirement

- Commands

    - ``dcore`` and others

- Environment variables

    - [optional] variable $NUM_PROC

## Description

A two-orbital model is solved in two ways: Two-band Wannier file with ``spin_orbit=False`` and four-band Wannier file with ``spin_orbit=True``. One can see that two ways give the same results.

The Wannier90-format file can be generated by the script file gen_hr.py
