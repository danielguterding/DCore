An example for spin_orbit=True
--------------------------------------

## Requirement

- Commands

    - ``dcore`` and others

    - ``pomerol2dcore``

    - ``gnuplot``

- Environment variables

    - [optional] variable $NUM_PROC

## Description

A two-orbital model is solved in two ways: Two-band Wannier file with ``spin_orbit=False`` and four-band Wannier file with ``spin_orbit=True``. One can see that two calculations give the same results.

Numerical results are stored in results/ and results_so/ for ``spin_orbit=False`` and ``spin_orbit=True``, respectively. Each includes plots of Sigma(iw), which will verify the equivalence of two results.

The Wannier90-format file included in this example can be generated by the script file gen_hr.py
