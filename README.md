# DCore

DCore is aimed at model calculations and ab-initio calculations by the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). This package consists of programs with text-based and hdf5-based interface. These programs enable users to perform DMFT calculations and analyze results without writing computer code. ALPS and TRIQS impurity solvers are supported.
