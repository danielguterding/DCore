CT-QMC with segment implementation: ``ALPS/CT-HYB-SEGMENT``
===========================================================

This impurity solver implements the CT-HYB segment algorithm.
Only density-density interactions are taken into account.
The off-diagonal components of the Green's functions are not computed correctly.
